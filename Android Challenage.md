# Android Challenge

An android development challenge for showing cards

## Introduction 
In this challenge, you are going to develop an android Card app which shows a random card on 
the main activity and has a 'Try' button. Whenever the user clicks on the 'Try' button, app 
should show him another random card which is not seen up to now.

Each card has at least 2 items:

- title
- description

We have different Cards which are shown differently:

- **Picture Card** which shows a picture at the end of card content (code is 0)
- **Vibrator Card** which vibrates the device when it is shown (code is 1)
- **Sound Card** which plays a sound when the card is shown (code is 2)

Cards can be shown in different themes meaning they will use a different icon and color representing their tag:

- sport
- art
- fun

You can choose your desired icon and color for each theme.

You should initialize cards list from this URL: [https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AmirrezaRotamian/Tech-Challenge/master/tempelate.json](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AmirrezaRotamian/Tech-Challenge/master/tempelate.json)

## Expectations

We want a clean, readable and maintainable code with meaningful comments and java docs.

## Estimation
